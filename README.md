Spoilery descriptions of what's really going on as I saw it.

Day 1 - zip a list with its own tail to compare adjacent pairs
Day 2 - fold the commands over the submarine state to get the final state
Day 3 - iteratively split ordered set of numbers at power of 2, choose winner two ways
Day 4 - model the bingo board, play many games simultaneously until desired winner is found
Day 5 - model paper as histogram of points, report points with 2 or more marks
Day 6 - track 9 counts of fish, one for each possible timer value
Day 7 - the median and average crab position!
Day 8 - eliminate possibilities from the a-g to a-g mapping table using "facts"
Day 9 - search the map starting from low points to find all locations in a basin
Day 10 - to autocomplete, repurpose the parser to find chunks in the reversed string, and discard them
Day 11 - iteratively apply whole grids of octopus states until they settle
Day 12 - use a remembered set to enumerate all paths
Day 13 - represent the paper with a set of points, mapping half to a reflection reduces the set size
Day 14 - there are 100 possible element pairs so this is similar to day 6
Day 15 - A-star algorithm can find the shortest / cheapest path
Day 16 - have the parser return an expression tree, then interpret the tree as stated to get a value
Day 17 - there are min and max bounds for x and y velocity to bound the search
Day 18 - to explode a snail expression, return additional exploding state with the updated snail
Day 19 - take reports from a bag that can be globbed into the expanding report until none remain
Day 20 - to allow infinite points to toggle, include a flag to indicate meaning of present set members
Day 21 - use non-deterministic computation to roll three dice three ways each time, tally player wins
Day 22 - union and minus cuboids explicitly by doing subdivisions and wholesale replacements (any dimension)
Day 23 - the possible moves are heavily restricted, making it easier to search the game tree
Day 24 - at 7 steps the procedure pushes a letter onto a stack, make sure it pops 7 times
Day 25 - the sea cucumbers form a cellular automaton on a periodic playing field
